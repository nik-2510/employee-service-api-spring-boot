# employee-service-api-spring-boot

This is project demonstrating the spring boot based microservice rest end points. For demonstration purpose, I have used H2 database and Spring Data JPA. 

This project has multiple end points covering all the HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. Tried following the standard practices and structure. 

Happy learning !!
